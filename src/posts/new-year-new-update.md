# New year, new update

As you can tell by the date of this post, it's not really the beginning of the new year I'm writing this. I started when it was still new, but life ran its course and things took longer then anticipated. Anyways, here's what I started with.

It's time to redo a couple of things. I've been posting to this blog on and off for around three years. And during my end of the year holidays, I thought I'd update my blog. You know, bringing all the dependencies to the latest version, stuff like that. And as you can guess, this broke everything. And it made me think about the state of things. As I mentioned in a previous post, this blog is running on Astro. And I've been quite happy with it.

## What I want to write here

- Talk about basically recreating the blog with Astro 5 because apparently it's impossible to just update JavaScript projects without breaking everything.
- Talk about using AI to write previous posts and feeling bad about it. Not doing it anymore.
