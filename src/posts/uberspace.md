# Uberspace

I recently made the decision to move my blog from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de). It ultimately came down to data sovereignty. With what's going on in the US, all the AI bullshit you have to deal with when using platforms like Netlify, it just didn't sit right with me anymore.

Beyond the geographical change, Uberspace offers me almost complete shell access and control over my hosting environment. Even though my blog is essentially a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), having this level of control means I can make adjustments whenever I need to.

I really like Uberspace's transparent pricing model. Their pay-what-you-want approach means I can support a service that aligns with my values and there's something refreshing about a company that trusts its users to decide what's fair compensation.

Moving away from US-based hosting also represents a conscious step toward reducing my dependence on American tech infrastructure. As global digital regulations continue to evolve and diverge, this independence feels increasingly important. The monthly cost I now pay is a small price for the confidence of knowing where my data lives.

For anyone concerned about data sovereignty and privacy, especially in today's complex geopolitical environment, considering European alternatives to US-based hosting makes sense. My transition to Uberspace wasn't just a technical decisionâ€”it was a statement about the kind of internet I want to support.
