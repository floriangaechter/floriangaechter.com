# Uberspace

I recently decided to move my blog from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de). It ultimately came down to data sovereignty. With what's going on in the US, all the AI bullshit you have to deal with when using platforms like Netlify, it just didn't sit right with me anymore.

But beyond the geographical change, Uberspace offers me almost complete shell access and control over my hosting environment. Even though my blog is just a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), having this level of control means I can make adjustments whenever I need to.

Another thing I really like about Uberspace is its transparent pricing model. Their pay-what-you-want approach means users can decide what's fair compensation and what's within their means. Additionally, I feel like their values really align with my own.

Moving away from US-based hosting also means a conscious step towards reducing my dependence on American tech infrastructure. The monthly cost I now pay is a small price for a good feeling.

If you're concerned about data sovereignty and privacy, especially in today's geopolitical environment, considering European alternatives to US-based hosting makes sense (at least to me). My transition to Uberspace wasn't just a technical decisionâ€”it was a statement about the kind of internet and by extension, world I want to support.

Of course moving from a set-it-and-forget-it solution like Netlify meant, that I couldn't take advantage of their build pipeline anymore, so I had to set up something custom with Gitub Actions. I might update this post in the future about how I managed to build and sync the site to Uberspace on pushes to the main branch.
