		<h1>A brief introduction</h1>
		<p class="lead">My name is Florian Gächter and I'm the creator of this blog. I started this blog to share things I've come across, that I think might help other people.</p>
		<p>I have always been interested in technology and I have been a developer for around 17 years.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors and spending time with my family. I'm also really into home automation. Mainly because I'm lazy and hate manually turning lights on and off…</p>
		<p>On this blog, you'll find a collection of my thoughts, experiences, and advice on things relating to my interests. I hope you find my posts informative, inspiring, and enjoyable. Thanks for reading!</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:flo@gaechter.xyz">reach out to me</a>.</p>
