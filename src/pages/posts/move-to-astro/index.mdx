After using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for my blog for a while, I decided to switch to [Astro](https://astro.build/) for several reasons. In this post, I will share why I made this decision.

First, let me start by saying that Gatsby is a great static site generator. It has a vibrant community, a rich ecosystem of plugins and themes, and impressive performance out of the box. I was able to quickly set up my blog and start publishing content with minimal effort. We're using Gatsby for our website at [Frontify](https://www.frontify.com/en/) as well. So I'm quite familiar with it.

However, working as a web developer (or more precisely, having worked in this field â€“ as I'm now working in Developer Relations), my goal is to try to create an as-fast-as-possible experience for my visitors. And while Gatsby is doing a great job, it always irked me that it relies so heavily on JavaScript. Even for something as simple as this blog.

On the other hand, Astro is a new and emerging static site generator that promises to solve these issues. It has a modern architecture and a flexible plugin system that allows me to focus on the content and the build process takes care of optimizing everything, with as little JavaScript as possible. It also has a strong focus on compatibility and stability, which means that I don't have to worry about breaking changes or version conflicts in the future.

With these things in mind, and my quest to try out new things, I decided to move my blog to Astro. And you can't just do such a move without thinking about the design as well now, can you? So I took the opportunity to revamp the look as well. It's based on the [Cool Writings Statamic Starter Kit](https://github.com/statamic/starter-kit-cool-writings) by [Jack McDade](https://twitter.com/jackmcdade).

I hope you like the new design and can feel the performance improvements ðŸ˜‰
